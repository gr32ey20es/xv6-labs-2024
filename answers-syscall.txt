Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
  -> usertrap function calls syscall

What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? 
(Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
  -> The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7 that 
  -> represents the SYS_exec system call number

What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
  -> The previous CPU mode was user mode

Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. 
Which register corresponds to the variable num?
  -> The assembly inst. that the kernel is panicing at is lw a3,0(zero)
  -> a3 register corresponds to the variable num

Why does the kernel crash? 
Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; 
      is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? 
      Is that confirmed by the value in scause above?
  -> The kernel crash is due to illegally accessing the memory
  -> Address 0 isn't mapped in the kernel address space
  -> The load page fault implied by the value in scause
  -> confirms the statement above

What is the name of the process that was running when the kernel paniced? 
What is its process id (pid)?
  -> The process called "initcode" that was running 
  -> when the kernel paniced is assigned 1 to pid
